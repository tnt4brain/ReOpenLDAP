This directory contains a slapd overlay, allop.
The intended usage is as a global overlay for use with those clients
that do not make use of the RFC3673 allOp ("+") in the requested
attribute list, but expect all operational attributes to be returned.
Usage: add to slapd.conf(5)

moduleload	contrib-allop.la
overlay		allop
allop-URI	<ldapURI>

if the allop-URI is not given, the rootDSE, i.e. "ldap:///??base",
is assumed.
