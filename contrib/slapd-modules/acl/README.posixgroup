This directory contains native slapd plugins that implement access rules.

posixgroup.c contains a simple example that implements access control
based on posixGroup membership, loosely inspired by ITS#3849.  It should
be made clear that this access control policy does not reflect any
standard track model of handling access control, and should be
essentially viewed as an illustration of the use of the dynamic
extension of access control within slapd.

To use the acl-posixgroup plugin, add:

moduleload contrib-posixgroup.la

to your slapd configuration file; it requires "nis.schema" to be loaded.
It is configured using

access to <what>
	by dynacl/posixGroup[.{exact,expand}]=<dnpat> {<level>|<priv(s)}

The default is "exact"; in case of "expand", "<dnpat>" results from
the expansion of submatches in the "<what>" portion.  "<level>|<priv(s)>"
describe the level of privilege this rule can assume.
