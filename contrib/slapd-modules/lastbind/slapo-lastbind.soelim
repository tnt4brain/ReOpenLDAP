.TH SLAPO-LASTBIND 5 "@RELEASE_DATE@" "ReOpenLDAP @VERSION@"

.SH NAME
slapo-lastbind \- lastbind overlay to slapd

.SH SYNOPSIS
@SYSCONFDIR@/slapd.conf

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B lastbind
overlay to
.BR slapd (8)
allows recording the timestamp of the last successful bind to entries
in the directory, in the
.B authTimestamp
attribute.
The overlay can be configured to update this timestamp only if it is
older than a given value, thus avoiding large numbers of write
operations penalizing performance.
One sample use for this overlay would be to detect unused accounts.

.SH CONFIGURATION
The config directives that are specific to the
.B lastbind
overlay must be prefixed by
.BR lastbind\- ,
to avoid potential conflicts with directives specific to the underlying
database or to other stacked overlays.

.TP
.B overlay lastbind
This directive adds the
.B lastbind
overlay to the current database, see
.BR slapd.conf (5)
for details.

.LP
This
.B slapd.conf
configuration option is defined for the lastbind overlay. It must
appear after the
.B overlay
directive:
.TP
.B lastbind-precision <seconds>
The value
.B <seconds>
is the number of seconds after which to update the
.B authTimestamp
attribute in an entry. If the existing value of
.B authTimestamp
is less than
.B <seconds>
old, it will not be changed.
If this configuration option is omitted, the
.B authTimestamp
attribute is updated on each successful bind operation.
.TP
.B lastbind_forward_updates
Specify that updates of the authTimestamp attribute
on a consumer should be forwarded
to a master instead of being written directly into the consumer's local
database. This setting is only useful on a replication consumer, and
also requires the
.B updateref
setting and
.B chain
overlay to be appropriately configured.

.SH EXAMPLE
This example configures the
.B lastbind
overlay to store
.B authTimestamp
in all entries in a database, with a 1 week precision.
Add the following to
.BR slapd.conf (5):

.LP
.nf
    database <database>
    # ...

    overlay lastbind
    lastbind-precision 604800
.fi
.LP
.B slapd
must also load
.B lastbind.la,
if compiled as a run-time module;

.SH FILES
.TP

.SH SEE ALSO
.BR slapd.conf (5),
.BR slapd (8).
The
.BR slapo-lastbind (5)
overlay supports dynamic configuration via
.BR back-config.

This module was written in 2009 by Jonathan Clarke. It is loosely
derived from the password policy overlay.
