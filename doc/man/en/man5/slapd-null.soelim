.TH SLAPD-NULL 5 "@RELEASE_DATE@" "ReOpenLDAP @VERSION@"

.SH NAME
slapd\-null \- Null backend to slapd

.SH SYNOPSIS
@SYSCONFDIR@/slapd.conf

.SH DESCRIPTION
The Null backend to
.BR slapd (8)
is surely the most useful part of
.BR slapd :
.br
- Searches return success but no entries.
.br
- Compares return compareFalse.
.br
- Updates return success (unless readonly is on) but do nothing.
.br
- Binds other than as the rootdn fail unless the database option "bind
on" is given.
.br
- The
.BR slapadd (8)
and
.BR slapcat (8)
tools are equally exciting.
.br
Inspired by the /dev/null device.
.SH CONFIGURATION
This
.B slapd.conf
option applies to the NULL backend database.
That is, it must follow a "database null" line and come before
any subsequent "database" lines.
Other database options are described in the
.BR slapd.conf (5)
manual page.
.TP
.B bind <on/off>
Allow binds as any DN in this backend's suffix, with any password.
The default is "off".
.TP
.B dosearch <on/off>
If enabled, a single entry will be returned on all search requests.
The entry's DN will be the same as the database suffix.
The default is "off".
.SH EXAMPLE
Here is a possible slapd.conf extract using the Null backend:
.LP
.RS
.nf
database null
suffix   "cn=Nothing"
bind     on
.fi
.RE
.SH ACCESS CONTROL
The
.B null
backend does not honor any of the access control semantics described in
.BR slapd.access (5).
