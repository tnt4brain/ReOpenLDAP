.SH NAME
slapo\-syncprov \- Sync Provider overlay to slapd

.SH SYNOPSIS
@SYSCONFDIR@/slapd.conf

.SH DESCRIPTION
The Sync Provider overlay implements the provider-side support for the
LDAP Content Synchronization (RFC4533) as well as syncrepl replication
support.  The overlay
can be used with any backend that maintains entryCSN and entryUUID
attributes for its entries. It also creates a contextCSN attribute in
the root entry of the database.

The contextCSN is updated for every write operation performed against the
database. To reduce database contention, the contextCSN is only updated in
memory. The value is written to the database on server shutdown and read into
memory on startup, and maintained in memory thereafter. Checkpoints may be
configured to write the contextCSN into the underlying database to minimize
recovery time after an unclean shutdown.

On databases that support inequality indexing, it is mandatory to set an
eq index on the entryCSN attribute when using this overlay.
.SH CONFIGURATION
These
.B slapd.conf
options apply to the Sync Provider overlay.
They should appear after the
.B overlay
directive.
.TP
.B syncprov\-checkpoint <ops> <minutes>
After a write operation has succeeded, write the contextCSN to the underlying
database if
.B <ops>
write operations or more than
.B <minutes>
time have passed
since the last checkpoint. Checkpointing is disabled by default.
.TP
.B syncprov\-sessionlog <ops>
Configures an in-memory session log for recording information about write
operations made on the database.  The
.B <ops>
specifies the number of operations that are recorded in the log. All write
operations (except Adds) are recorded in the log.
When using the session log, it is helpful to set an eq index on the
entryUUID attribute in the underlying database.
.TP
.B syncprov\-nopresent TRUE | FALSE
Specify that the Present phase of refreshing should be skipped. This value
should only be set TRUE for a syncprov instance on top of a log database
(such as one managed by the accesslog overlay).
The default is FALSE.
.TP
.B syncprov\-reloadhint TRUE | FALSE
Specify that the overlay should honor the reloadHint flag in the Sync
Control. It must be set TRUE when using the accesslog overlay for
delta-based syncrepl replication support.
The default is FALSE.
.TP
.B syncprov\-showstatus { none | running | all }
.RS
Specifies when an additional substitute value will be added for the
contextCSN attribute to indicate the currently relevant
synchroniztaion/replication status across all the configured
syncrepl replication consumers for the database
corresponding to the current syncprov overlay. Such an additional
value is added by the LDAP server only in response
to a request that involves retrieving the contextCSN attribute;
it indicates the synchronization/replication status at the time of the
request and is never saved to the database. See below
for the value format.
.LP
\fINote:\fP
The LDAP Content Synchronization protocol (RFC4533) has a flaw.
This flaw may occur in multi-master mode with three or more masters,
causing a delete operation to be ignored if an add or modify
operation is following it. So, there may be a situation where
LDAP instances that participate in replication have matching sets of
contextCSN values, which may result in there being entries that get deleted
from the replication provider but remain on the replication consumers
and are never deleted by the replication/synchronization mechanism.
To prevent this situation, ReOpenLDAP, when synchronizing in
multi-master mode, does an additional check to see
if the existing entries match. However, this cannot be
tracked down only by looking at the set of contextCSN values
as, due to the protocol flaw described above, these values may
not change. An additional substitute value for the contextCSN attribute
allows for tracking the actual status of the synchronization process,
both in normal mode and when an additional content check is done.
.TP
.B none
No additional contextCSN is ever added.
In this mode, OpenLDAP works as it used to work originally.
.RE
.RS
.TP
.B running
An additional contextCSN value is added if there are
active outgoing connections from syncrepl replication
consumers for which synchronization has not been finished yet.
But syncrepl instances that failed to reconnect to their
syncprov replication providers are not taken into account.
This mode is enabled by default.
.RE
.RS
.TP
.B all
An additional contextCSN value is added if there is at least
one syncrepl instance with unfinished or unsuccessful
synchronization, including failed attempts to connect
to syncprov replication providers.
.LP
The contextCSN value \fIformat\fP is as follows:
.B YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.ttttttZ#xxxxxx#SID#ABC.DE
.RE
.RS
.TP
.B A
A hexadecimal digit that shows the number of
syncrepl instances which failed to connect to
syncprov replication providers (DEAD).
If greater than 15, it is assumed to be 0xF.
.TP
.B B
A hexadecimal digit that shows the number of
syncrepl instances that have not started synchronization yet or that
failed to synchronize after connecting to
a syncprov replication provider (DIRTY).
If greater than 15, it is assumed to be 0xF.
.TP
.B C
A hexadecimal digit that shows the number of syncrepl
instances that have connected to syncprov replication
providers but have not yet completed the initial
content synchronization or an additional check
of the existing entries (REFRESH).
If greater than 15, it is assumed to be 0xF.
.TP
.B D
A hexadecimal digit that shows the number of syncrepl
instances that have connected to syncprov replication providers,
have completed the initial synchronization and are now
processing the latest update from the
syncprov replication provider (PROCESS).
If greater than 15, it is assumed to be 0xF.
.TP
.B E
A hexadecimal digit that shows the number of syncrepl
instances that have finished synchronizing and processing
the latest updates from the
syncprov replication provider (READY).
If greater than 15, it is assumed to be 0xF.
.TP
.B SID
A local server identifier (serverID) in hexadecimal format.
.TP
.B xxxxxx
Ensures a unique checksum for
the local identifiers (RID) of every
syncrepl instance configured for a given database.
.TP
.B YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.tttttt
A timestamp (down to the millisecond) that shows
the time of the latest status update that is reflected
in the contextCSN value that has been added.
