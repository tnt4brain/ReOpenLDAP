.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B ldap_delete_s()
routine is used to perform an LDAP delete operation
synchronously. It takes \fIdn\fP, the DN of the entry to be deleted.
It returns an LDAP error code, indicating the success or failure of the
operation.
.LP
The
.B ldap_delete()
routine is used to perform an LDAP delete operation
asynchronously. It takes the same parameters as
.BR ldap_delete_s(),
but returns the message id of the request it initiated. The result of
the delete can be obtained by a subsequent call to
.BR ldap_result (3).
.LP
The
.B ldap_delete_ext()
routine  allows  server  and client controls to be
specified to extend the delete request. This routine is asynchronous like
ldap_delete(), but its return value is an LDAP error code. It stores the
message id of the request in the integer pointed to by msgidp.
.LP
The
.B ldap_delete_ext_s()
routine is the synchronous version of
.BR ldap_delete_ext().
It also returns an LDAP error code indicating success
or failure of the operation.
.SH ERRORS
.B ldap_delete_s()
returns an LDAP error code which can be interpreted
by calling one of
.BR ldap_perror (3)
and friends.
.B ldap_delete()
returns \-1 if something went wrong initiating the request. It returns the
non-negative message id of the request if things went ok.
.LP
.B ldap_delete_ext()
and
.B ldap_delete_ext_s()
return some Non-zero value if
something  went wrong initiating the request, else return 0.
